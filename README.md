# PeopleChain — Flutter P2P SDK and App
# PeopleChain

PeopleChain is an on-device, peer-to-peer data network for secure, resilient communication without central servers. It powers end-to-end encrypted chat, distributed data sync, and edge IoT collaboration using compact blocks and WebRTC transports.

## Vision and Goals
- Privacy-first communication with keys that never leave the device
- Offline-first operation with automatic discovery and healing
- No mandatory cloud: run locally, on LAN, or across the Internet
- Simple SDK that works on Android, Web, and Linux

## Architecture
- Core Node (lib/peoplechain_core): local chain, tx/block store, sync engine
- Discovery Node (nodescript): zero-dependency HTTP relay for WebRTC signaling
- WebRTC Transport: fully P2P data channel for sync and messaging
- P2P Manager: multi-transport discovery (Discovery relay, mDNS, BLE, Wi‑Fi Direct, Nearby)
- Node Monitor Server: lightweight embedded dashboard and API explorer

## Installation and Usage

### Android
1. Build the Flutter app (Android target). The node runs on-device.
2. Start a Discovery Node on your PC if you want cross-subnet rendezvous: see docs/discovery/USAGE.md.

### Web
1. Run the Flutter Web build or use Dreamflow preview.
2. Ensure the Discovery Node is reachable from the browser (CORS friendly). See docs/discovery/USAGE.md.

### Linux/Desktop
1. Launch the app; Node Monitor Server binds on 127.0.0.1:8080 and serves a dashboard.
2. Use curl against /api for scripting. See docs/monitor/USAGE.md.

## Real-world Use Cases
- Secure chat and media with content-based chunking and re-assembly
- Distributed sensor data capture and local-first analytics for IoT
- Air-gapped cyber defense and incident coordination
- LAN collaboration in constrained or disconnected environments
